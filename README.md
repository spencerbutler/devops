scripts to make development operational

## Notes
- [/etc/machine-id](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/machine-id.5.html)
For operating system images which are created once and used on multiple machines, for
example for containers or in the cloud, /etc/machine-id should be an empty file in the
generic file system image.
